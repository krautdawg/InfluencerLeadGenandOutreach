# K+L Influence - Instagram Lead Generation Platform

## Project Overview
A sophisticated Instagram lead generation platform that leverages advanced web scraping, AI-powered data enrichment, and intelligent marketing list creation with enhanced user experience.

**Current Status**: Enhanced with Emergency STOP functionality

## Recent Changes (July 22, 2025)
âœ“ **Emergency STOP System - Enhanced with Gunicorn Worker Restart**: Ultimate forceful termination
  - **REMOVED**: Regular stop functionality completely eliminated
  - **ENHANCED**: Emergency stop now triggers gunicorn worker restart for ultimate force termination
  - **NEW**: `force_worker_restart()` function touches main.py to trigger worker reload
  - **IMMEDIATE**: Worker restart kills ALL processes instantly (threads, API calls, loops)
  - Prominent red ðŸ›‘ NOTFALL STOPP button with pulsing animation 
  - Enhanced backend `/emergency-stop-processing` endpoint:
    * Sets all stop flags immediately
    * Triggers gunicorn worker restart via file modification
    * Provides UI feedback about worker restart status
  - JavaScript enhanced to detect worker restart and reload page automatically
  - Ultimate forceful termination - no process can survive worker restart

## Project Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Flask web framework with SQLAlchemy
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with comprehensive lead tracking
- **APIs**: Apify Instagram scraping, OpenAI GPT-4o, Perplexity for enrichment
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap 5, responsive design with advanced UI controls
- **Processing**: Asynchronous Python with ThreadPoolExecutor

### Key Features
1. **Instagram Data Scraping**: Hashtag-based profile discovery
2. **AI-Powered Enrichment**: Contact information discovery via Perplexity API
3. **Email Generation**: Personalized outreach emails using OpenAI
4. **Product Integration**: Product-based campaign customization
5. **Emergency Controls**: Multi-level stop mechanisms for process control

### Processing Flow
1. Hashtag discovery phase with user selection
2. Profile enrichment in batches with anti-spam delays
3. AI-powered contact information discovery
4. Personalized email generation with product integration

### Emergency Stop System
- **ONLY Emergency Stop**: Immediate forceful termination via `/emergency-stop-processing`
- **No Regular Stop**: Regular stop functionality completely removed per user request
- **Forceful Termination**: Multiple rapid stop requests ensure immediate process killing
- **UI Controls**: Single prominent emergency button with pulsing animation
- **Multi-Level Checks**: Emergency stop verified in all processing loops and API calls
- **State Management**: Complete UI and backend state reset capabilities

## User Preferences
- Language: German (DE) for UI elements
- Processing: Batch-based with progress tracking
- Safety: Anti-spam delays and memory-conscious limits
- UX: Immediate feedback and comprehensive error handling

## Development Guidelines
