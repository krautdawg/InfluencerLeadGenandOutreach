  - Profile enrichment API returns different data structure than hashtag search API
  - Field mapping was incorrect between API response and database schema
- **Resolution**: 
  - Created dedicated `call_apify_profile_enrichment` function for profile API

### 2025-07-09: Fixed Username Extraction and Memory Issues (COMPLETED)
- **Issue**: User reports getting only a fraction of expected usernames from hashtag search
- **Investigation**: 
  - Username extraction logic was already correct (processes both `topPosts` and `latestPosts`)
  - Real issue was memory overflow (SIGKILL errors) and poor error handling causing processing failures
- **Fixes Implemented**:
  - **Enhanced Username Extraction**: Added robust type checking and error handling for both `topPosts` and `latestPosts` arrays
  - **Memory Optimization**: Reduced max_items from 300 to 200, batch_size from 100 to 50
  - **Better Error Handling**: Added try-catch blocks around hashtag data processing and username extraction
  - **Improved Logging**: Added detailed logging to track extraction process and identify failures
  - **Memory Management**: Clear variables immediately after use, force garbage collection
  - **Robust Processing**: Continue processing even if some items fail, don't crash entire operation
- **Benefits**: 
  - More reliable username extraction from both post arrays
  - Better memory management to prevent SIGKILL errors
  - Robust error handling that continues processing instead of crashing
  - Detailed logging for debugging issues
- **Status**: Improvements implemented and application restarted successfully

### 2025-07-09: Simplified Hashtag Logic and Fixed Template Error (COMPLETED)
- **Issue**: Complex hashtag extraction causing issues and template error with missing filter
- **Resolution**: Simplified logic to use search keyword as hashtag and fixed template
- **Changes Made**:
  - **Simplified Processing**: Only extract unique ownerUsername from posts, no hashtag filtering
  - **Database Logic**: Use initial search keyword for hashtag column in all database operations
  - **Template Fix**: Changed `tojsonfilter` to `tojson` to fix template rendering error
  - **Clean Logic**: Removed complex hashtag mapping and regex processing
  - **Consistent Storage**: All leads use search keyword as hashtag for consistency
- **Benefits**: 
  - Simpler, more reliable code
  - Faster processing without complex hashtag extraction
  - Fixed template errors that were causing application crashes
  - Consistent hashtag data based on search terms
- **Status**: Successfully simplified and application running without errors

- **Issue**: Application experiencing SIGKILL errors due to memory exhaustion and frontend showing "unexpected error"
- **Resolution**: Implemented extremely aggressive memory optimization and fixed frontend/backend sync issues
- **Changes Made**:
  - **Aggressive Batch Processing**: Reduced batch size from 20 to 10 items with forced garbage collection
  - **Item Limits**: Reduced maximum item limit from 1000 to 300 to prevent memory overflow
  - **Essential Data Only**: Strip unnecessary fields from Apify responses, keep only required data
  - **Database Optimization**: Reduced batch commit size from 20 to 10 with proper session cleanup
  - **Concurrent Processing**: Further reduced from 3 to 2 simultaneous operations for profile enrichment
  - **Sequential Processing**: Changed from parallel to sequential batch processing to minimize memory usage
  - **Search Limits**: Reduced maximum search limit from 100 to 50 for memory safety
  - **Username Limits**: Added hard limit of 50 usernames processed per request
  - **Frequent GC**: Added forced garbage collection after each batch and processing delay (0.3s)
  - **Processing Delay**: Increased delays between operations to reduce memory pressure
  - **Frontend Fixes**: 
    - Updated search limit validation from 100 to 50
    - Fixed timeout alignment (190s frontend vs 180s backend)
    - Improved error handling to ignore browser extension rejections
    - Added detailed error logging for debugging
  - **Frontend Update**: Updated UI to reflect new search limits (max 50, default 25)
- **Status**: Memory usage heavily optimized, SIGKILL errors resolved, frontend/backend errors fixed, Apify processing working successfully

### 2025-07-09: Integrated PostgreSQL Database
- **Issue**: Application was using in-memory storage which lost data on restart
- **Resolution**: Added PostgreSQL database integration using Flask-SQLAlchemy
- **Changes Made**:
  - Created `models.py` with Lead and ProcessingSession database models
  - Updated main.py to use SQLAlchemy database operations
  - Replaced in-memory `app_data['leads']` storage with database persistence
  - Added proper error handling and transaction management
  - Updated all CRUD operations to work with database models
  - Maintained existing API compatibility with to_dict() serialization
- **Status**: Database successfully integrated, data now persists between sessions

### 2025-07-09: Fixed Frontend Error Handling and Server Stability
- **Issue**: Frontend showing "unexpected error occurred" and server crashes during processing

  - Implemented request timeout protection (5 minutes) on frontend
  - Added automatic session modal display for missing credentials
  - Enhanced logging throughout the processing pipeline
  - Added fallback handling for empty results
  - Improved exception handling to prevent server crashes
- **Status**: Application now properly handles errors and provides clear user feedback

### 2025-07-09: Fixed Apify API Integration
- **Issue**: API calls were timing out due to incorrect input format and direct HTTP calls
- **Resolution**: Updated to use official Apify client library with correct API formats
- **Changes Made**:
  - Hashtag search now uses: `{"search": keyword, "searchType": "hashtag", "searchLimit": 100}`
  - Profile enrichment uses: `{"instagram_ids": [urls], "SessionID": sessionid, "proxy": {...}}`
  - Replaced direct HTTP calls with `ApifyClient` library for better reliability
  - Fixed data processing to handle multiple profile results correctly
- **Status**: Backend API integration confirmed working, processes results successfully
